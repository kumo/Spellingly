# Spellingly

Spellingly provides an easy way of spelling things, by converting a word into individual letters, each with their own spelling, for example, A (Alfa).

## Installation

~~The easiest way is to download it from the App Store.~~

For now, you can [download](https://github.com/kumo/Spellingly/tags) the source code, compile it with Xcode, and install it on your iOS device.

If you choose to build it yourself, you will need to change the developer identity.
